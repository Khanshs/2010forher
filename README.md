## 20/10 Women's Day 
(Source/idea: if someone originally created this idea, please contact me so I can update the description <3)

### How to use:
1. Clone the repo.  
2. Customize it however you like — restyle, rename, or send your own message to someone you love.  
3. To add images, put them in the **images** folder and name them as `img1.jpg`, `img2.jpg`, etc.

HTML is simple, so I’ll let you explore the rest yourself :)
> No matter how messy your version looks, she (or any girl) will still smile knowing you made it for her.
